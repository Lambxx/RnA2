\question[5]{Task 1.1: Describing The World State}
\begin{framed}
%

\emph{Warehouse, i.e. layout of the warehouse and which cells are connected.
objects --

Warehouse cells:
c51,c52,c53,c54,c55
c41,c42,c43,c44,c45
c31,c32,c33,c34,c35
c21,c22,c23,c24,c25
c11,c12,c13,c14,c15
CHANGE THIS CELLS ONLY CONNECTED IF ADJACENT
NON DIAGANOL CELLS NOT CONNECTED
i will list all  unconnected cells all other cells are connected
no cx1 cell is connected to a cx5 cell where x is any value 1-5
no c5x cell is connected to a c1x cell
cell c31 and c41 not connexted
cell c32 and cel c44 not connected
cell c53 and cell c53 not connected

matilbot: bot
portable Scanner: portableScanner
packages : 001, 010, 011
deliveryBelt: belt
Switch: switch

predicates:

Connected (x,y) -- retuns true if cells x and y connected
BeltOn(x) -- true iff  delivery belt is turned on.
Scanned(x) --  true iff x scanned
HoldingObj(bot,x) -- true iff bot holding an object x
Holding(bot) -- ture iff bot holding a non specified object
On(x,y) -- ture iff object x is on cell y
Occupied(x) -- true iff something on cell x
Bot(x) -- true iff x is a Bot
Cell(x) -- true iff x is a cell
Movable(x) -- true iff x is a pickupable object eg scanner
Package(x) -- true iff x is a package
Scanner(x) -- true iff x is a scanner
Switch(x) -- true iff x is a Switch
Belt(x) -- true iff x is a belt

% write your answer here
\emph{

Action(Move(block, from, to)):
PRECOND : On(b,from) ∧(block) ∧ not Occupied(to)∧
Block(block) ∧Block(to)∧
(block ̸= from) ∧ (block ̸= to) ∧ (from ̸= to)
EFFECT : On(block, to) ∧On(block, from)∧
not Occupied (from) ∧ ̸= not Occupied(to)

MailBot can move between two tiles if they are connected. MailBot cannot move diagonally
or through the wall.

Action(Move(bot, from, to)):
PRECOND : On(bot,from) and not Occupied(to)
and connected(from, to) and Bot(bot)
EFFECT : On(bot, to) ∧ not On(bot, from) and
not Occupied (from) and Occupied(to)

Action(Pickup(bot,object,cell)):
PRECOND : On(bot,cell) and On(object,cell) and
not Holding(bot) and Bot(bot) and Movable(object)
EFFECT : HoldingObj(bot,object) and Holding(bot)
and not On(object,cell) and not occcupied (cell)

Action( Scan(bot,object,cell,scanner)):
PRECOND : On(bot,cell) and On(object,cell) and
 HoldingObj(bot,scanner) and Bot(bot) and Movable(object) and
Scanner(scanner) and not Scanned(object)
EFFECT : scanned(object)

Action(turnOn(bot,cell,switch,belt)):
PRECOND : On(bot,cell) and On(switch,cell) and
Bot(bot) and Switch(switch) and Belt(belt)
EFFECT : BeltOn(belt)
